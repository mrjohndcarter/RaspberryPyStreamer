# RaspberryPyStreamer
Stream live HLS video from your RPI.

A python script that will read live video from your Pi Camera module, segment it into .ts files and generates an M3U8 file.

This was done in a single day as part of the 2nd Youi.TV Hackday.  There is an additional web-based control page that I'll post in the near future.

## Requirements
* Raspberry Pi Board
* Raspberry Pi Camera
* SD Card, Ethernet Cable
